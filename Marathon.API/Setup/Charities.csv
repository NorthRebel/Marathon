14,Querstadtein Berlin,"Querstadtein is the first project of Stadtsichten e.V., a registered non-profit association.

Although it is visible everywhere in the city, homelessness is rarely discussed. On a theoretical level we often know very little about a topic that confronts us in the streets every day. Through querstadtein we would like to raise awareness of this issue.

It all started with the desire of our two founders to get something ‘real’ off the ground in Berlin, to actively tackle an issue instead of just thinking about it. Homeless people seemed to be everywhere, throughout the city and on the daily commute to the office. Some of them were there day in, day out, in the U-Bahn or on the street. The divide between the homeless people and the rest of society was striking. This is where we wanted to be active – to create a space which would facilitate encounters, exchange and awareness.

We would like your help to help the homeless in Berlin."
